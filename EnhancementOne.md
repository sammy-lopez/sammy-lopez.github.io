## Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design 
For my first artifact I chose to expand off of the skills I learned in my CS-330 course that i completed in December 2020. The course focused on creation of a 3D object using C++ 
and OpenGL. For my initial submission for the course final, I created a dining chair. For this artifact I chose to create a new object using the same skill, but this time I made
a bookshelf.  
I chose to include this artifact in my portolfio because it was one that most applied to the field I would like to enter. The gaming industry has for the msot part moved away from
using these methods to develop games. Most studios now rely on programs that have been created and tailored specifically to aid in game design. These would be programs like Unreal 
Engine, Unity, and GameMaker. Still I thought it important to display my ability to use more traditional methods to create 3D objects.  
When going to create this artifact I was fortunate enough to have recently completed this course so much of it was still fresh in my memory. Still, I struggled with the initial 
project and ran into many hurdles when creating this project. The biggest help I found was my inital code was well outlined and commented. I also chose an object that used 
predominantly straight lines. I found myself ofen going back to previous sections of the project to assure that everything was consecutive and by the end arrived at a fully lit 
and textured object that reflects exactly what I wanted to create.
