# Introduction
I began my journey through the SNHU Computer Science program in 2018 with the intention of entering the gaming industry. I struggled with choosing what path to commit my life to and have always had a love for games and the unique interaction with the story they can tell. I still hold these values but throughout the courses I have taken I have been introduced to many other aspects within computer science that I have learned to enjoy. I have also learned of the values and standards that I should hold myself to within the industry. The majority of my courses were predicated by the assumption I would be working in a team environment and how vital it is to keep a healthy communication between all aspects of the project. That being with other team members, developers from other areas and departments, and shareholders. By far this was the biggest takaway regarding how to ensure a project's development proceeds without difficulty. I experienced this firsthand during my GAM-305 course where I was tasked along with four other classmates to take on a role within a game development team to develop a working game within eight weeks. It was one of the most exciting courses I had and was fortunate enough to have a team that was great at communcating and together we created a simple but entertaining game by the end.  
I also learned the importance of security that goes in to protecting the products we create. Too easily can the digital works and properties we work with every day be violated. Whether it be through stolen assets, unverified access, or harmful software intrustions. For all of these proper precautions must be taken to keep out potential threats to our systems. Luckily, many of the common practice in digital security were stressed in each of my courses. This includes password protection and even more so protection of the access to those passwords, properly identifying a threat when first encountered, and being properly educated on the threats that we as developers face. While I stated the imporatnce of communication within teh industry, security is equally as important and I feel fortunate to have been equipped with the tools to provide a strong security to my work throughout this course.
