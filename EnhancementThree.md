## Enhancement Three: Databases
For my databases artifact, I worked off of my teachings from course DAD-220, Introduction to Database Systems. Here I got the chance to begin learning about SQL and its database management capabilities. I chose to use these skills to build a new database which contains various released games. All of the entries are compiled into tables seperating them by developer, and each table includes the columns to describe each entries name, rating, release date, and genre. I then go further to expand some of the tables by changin some of the entries values and adding more columns to further describe the entries.  
  
I chose to include this artifact in my porfolio because efficient database creation and management are important in keeping information organized and easily accessible. Databases are used in many different fields and you would be hardpressed to find one that doesn't utilize databases in some way. My intention with this artifact was to show my ability to create a database and use the proper commands to maintain and update it as needed. A large part of SQL's power is its ability to filter and group entries based of column criteria and compare them to one another. This database was built with that in mind and if utilized would be able to perform those functions. 
  
The largest challenge I faced with this artifact is similar to my second artifact. Throught these courses everything is very fast paced and once a semester ends, the next often begins wihtout much time. Because of its fast paced nature I would quickly begin to focus on the enxt subject while leaving the rpevious behind. When deciding what courses to revisit, I chose to pick subjects I enjoyed more than ones I was more expereinced with. Luckily I had previous assignments available to me and that combined with research through the internet I was able to refresh myself to develop this artifact.
