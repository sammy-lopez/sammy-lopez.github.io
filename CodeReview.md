## Refinement Plan
My selection for my first artifact is to rework my final project from CS 330. In this course we were tasked with creating a 3D object and I really enjoyed it. My goals after graduating are to enter the game industry and I believe that showing off my ability to create 3D objects will show my proficiency for the field. I would like to create an entirely new object based on the previous one I had made. This includes camera tools and lighting that were present in my initial submission.  
  
My selection for the second artifact is to expand on my project from CS 250. I learned about the software development lifecycle, which includes the different approaches to software development, specifically agile. My plan is to create a new agile plan and fill in the roles of each member of a scrum team to show my understanding of each role and its responsibilities. I believe that showing a good understanding of the development cycle, specifically how project development will grow how problems throughout will be handled and resolved, will show how that I am ready to enter the industry and already have a good understand of how development will be treated.  
  
My selection for the third category is to further refine my final project from DAD 220. The use of databases in computer science is essential and I enjoyed my experience with creating them and adding more functionality to them would be a good learning experience. My plan is to create a new repository with SQL functionality to show the skills I have obtained through the course while also showing my ability to create repositories based on the need of a system. The database will house information based on various video games from previous years.  
## Code Review
Below I have included a code review of the intital project that I have built the artifacts from. This does not include the second artifact as there is no code associated with said artifact.
